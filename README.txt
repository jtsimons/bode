This program can be used to generate Bode magnitude and phase plots for continuous LTI transfer functions.
The user is prompted to enter the coefficients of both numerator and denominator polynomials in descending order, starting from the highest order term.
If the numerator and denominator are not fully simplified and expanded, this will not work.
These instructions as well as a few brief examples are displayed to the user at startup.
